# Description:
This program is a basic simulation of an everychanging stock market. The program simulates the change that occurs whilst trading stocks across a seven day period. Within each day the user has the option to buy/sell one of five stocks (Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Nike, and Microsoft). The user has the option to use the results page to check their current buy or sell price of the given stock to aid in their decision. After all decisions are made for a given day, the user moves to the next day in which the prices have changed. The user is given the same two options to buy/sell for the five stocks. After the conclusion of the seventh day, the user can go to the results page and click the 'Calc P/L($)' to check their Profit/Loss after the completed week. 

# Purpose:
The purpose of this code is to help people put into effect basic ideas behind market trading in a very basic manner. This is designed for beginners who just want a simple simulation to test ideas they may have about trading.

# Install:
